# High School and College Information Technology Certification Paths
## Purpose
As a student, your end goal is not limited to getting good grades or getting into a good college. Instead, you are building skills and experience towards landing that first job that will lead to a life-time long career in the information technology sector. You may want to manage cloud infrastructure, write software or games, hack into networks and web applications, or create Internet of Things devices. To do that, you first have to be able to demonstrate to a potential employer that you should be interviewed - to get your foot into the door to be considered for that job. This resource is intended to complement the high school and college course you are taking with recommendations of certifications to pursue.

### Certification Selection
To select the right certifications, you first must know what kind of career you would like to pursue. Then, you should consider entry-level job listings and the certifications they list as "required" and "desired". You want to stand out above the other candidates, so the more of those "required" and "desired" qualifications you can check, the better chance you have at being considered for that job. Additionally, the course work you pursue in high school and college will often be aligned to industry standard certifications - which might require only a nominal amount of additional studying to prepare you for and pass those exams.
