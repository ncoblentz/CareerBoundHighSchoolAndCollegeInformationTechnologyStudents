# Certification and Career Recommendations for Johnson County, KS High School and College IT Students

**Purpose**

As a student, your end goal is not limited to getting good grades or getting into a good college. Instead, you are building skills and experience towards landing that first job that will lead to a life long career in the information technology sector. You may want to manage cloud infrastructure, design data centers, write software or games, hack into networks and web applications, or create Internet of Things devices. To do that, you first have to be able to demonstrate to a potential employer that you should be interviewed - to get your foot into the door to be considered for that job. This resource is intended to complement the high school and college courses you are taking with recommendations of certifications, professional experience, and/or college courses to pursue to increase your chances of getting interviewed for your desired career field based on real job descriptions in the Kansas City area.

**Building Your Skills, Experience, and Earning Certifications**

When employers review a candidate's resume and cover letter, they are discerning whether the person meets the qualifications for the posted job and deciding who would most likely be successful in that organization and role. They are going to weigh the education, skills, and experience the candidate already brings to the table versus the amount of training (and time) it will take to get them fully functional in that role. You can make that decision easier for the employer by demonstrating your skills and experience through:
1. Certifications
2. Volunteer and work experience (at school, church, non-profit organizations, etc.)
3. Completed projects (whether for school or as a hobby) that the employer can access on Github and Youtube (or other similar sites)
4. Education

More on certifications, projects, and displaying that work can be found within this presentation: [Johnson County Community College: So you Want to be an Application Security Engineer?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul6kdub0CuQ)

## Start Where You Are

Your journey begins now... Are you a current high school student or are you a college student? How much education do you want to puruse? What kind of job do you want to get in the IT field? Begin with the statements below that best match your situation (or explore all of them): 

- [I am a high school student and I plan to seek a job without pursuing a college degree...](#high-school-student-seeking-a-job-without-a-college-degree)
- [I am a high school student and I plan to pursue an associates or bachelors degree...](#high-school-student-pursuing-an-associates-or-bachelors-degree)
- [I am a current college student...](#college-student)

### High School Student Seeking a Job Without a College Degree

To get a job as a high school graduate, it's going to be critically important that you grow in maturity (attitude, punctuality, reliability, professionalism, ability to manage time well, meeting deadlines, etc.) as well as have some kind of external demonstration of skill and experience. While pursuing your high school courses, you should focus on gaining entry-level certifications and working or volunteering in the field you plan to pursue. 

Once you get that first job, continue to pursue more advanced certifications. Then, after gaining several years of experience (3 to 5 years), your options for employment greatly increase. You have an opportunity to move around to a more exciting specialty or a more desirable company. That doesn't mean you have to move companies however. Ideally, your current employer will recognize your value and promote you. 

Without a college degree, you may hit road bumps. Some companies and HR departments struggle to interview even the most qualified candidate simply because he or she doesn't have a college degree. To over come that, join professional organizations and build a wide variety of friendships across companies. Later, when you might need to change employers, those individuals may be able to get past otherwise difficult to surmount HR filters and you likewise can help them.

Alteratively, you can also pursue an associates or bachelors degree while working. Many employers have tuition reimbursement programs that will pay for your college (after the fact and often with a certain letter grade requirement). This effectively allows you to start earning a salary, take on zero debt, and pursue that degree with a lot more real world experience and maturity.

The following sections are going to be helpful for you to dig into further:
1. [Explore entry-level positions in your desired field](#explore-careers-and-entry-level-positions)
1. [Pursue cerifications while in high school (and after getting that entry-level position)](#certifications)
2. Get internships, apprenticeships, or volunteering in the field you plan to work
3. [Join outside professional organizations](#kansas-city-area-professional-organizations-and-conferences)
4. [Build your resume and LinkedIn Profile](#applying-for-jobs)

### High School Student Pursuing an Associates or Bachelors Degree
If college is your next step as a high school student, you have a variety of options, including pursuing a Certificate or Associates degree at a community college as well as going to a four year college (either immediately or after community college). The strategy and decisions about which path to pick is beyond the scope of this document, except in identifying community colleges in the Johnson County, Kansas area and the specific features of those programs that may aid you in getting to the IT career you desire. Let's start first by identifying opportunities at the high school level to gain college credit and pursue certifiations.

School districts in the Johnson County, KS area have a variety of ways to begin earning college credit while still in school. Those options include:
- [AP classes and testing for college credit](#johnson-county-kansas-high-school-programs)
- [Dual credit classes](#johnson-county-kansas-high-school-programs)
- [Testing out of classes (Credit by Examination) at the college level](#johnson-county-kansas-high-school-programs)
- [Excel in CTE (Free CTE Related College Courses and Credit)](#johnson-county-kansas-high-school-programs)
- Get high school and college credit for an internship or apprenticeship

Additionally, you may be interested in building up professional certifications and experience. Currently, no Johnson County, KS area high school programs and classes (that I'm aware of) specifically line up with any IT related certifications, so you would need to pursue those independently (more on this below). As far as work experience, siimlar to getting a job after high school, you will want to pursue internships or volunteer opportunities. However, earning college credit and getting close to that finish line of earning a degree will often be the higher priority.

The following sections are going to be helpful for you to dig into further:
- While still in high school:
  1. [Explore entry-level positions in your desired field](#explore-careers-and-entry-level-positions)
  2. [Considering programs available at area school districts and high schools](#johnson-county-kansas-high-school-programs)
  3. [Earning college credit while in high school](#johnson-county-kansas-high-school-programs)
- When planning for college:
  1. Consider programs available at area colleges
  1. [Pursue cerifications while in college](#certifications)
  2. Get internships, apprenticeships, or volunteering in the field you plan to work


### College Student
Working on this section still...

- Efficiency
  - Take tests to get college credit: CLEP
  - Maximize less expensive tuition at community colleges, perhaps save money by living at home with parents
  - College credit through internship or apprenticeship programs
  - Join campus clubs
- Marketability 
  - Many other college students are going to graduate with the same degree and similar grades as you. How will you stand out?
    - Goes back to certifications, work experience, demonstrable projects
- community college -> career
  - Associates, Certificates, Certifications, Experience
- community college -> bachelors
  - Transferable college credit, Certifications if aligned

## Certifications

To select the right certifications, you first must know what kind of career you would like to pursue. Then, you should consider entry-level job listings and the certifications they list as "required" and "desired". You want to stand out above the other candidates, so the more of those "required" and "desired" qualifications you can check, the better chance you have at being considered for that job. Additionally, the course work you pursue in high school and college will often be aligned to industry standard certifications - which might require only a nominal amount of additional studying to prepare you for and pass those exams. The table below shows an example of courses at Johnson County Community Colelge that align.

|Program|A+|Linux+|Network+|Security+|Pentest+|PCEP|Cisco CNA|Cisco CyberOps Associate|Microsoft MD-101 Managing Modern Desktops|Microsoft MS-900 365 Fundamentals|Microsoft AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals|Microsoft AZ-104 Azure Administrator|Associate VMWare Data Center Virtualization|Google Associate Cloud Engineer|AWS Cloud Practicioner|AWS SysOps Administrator|LPIC-1|

The following sections list entry-level certifications and where possible, include free or low cost training options to prepare for those courses. For each option, It's recommended that you purchase a recently published (and official if possible) book to make sure you've covered all the course material.

### CompTIA Certifications
The following links provide a description of several CompTIA certifications and the types of jobs typically associated with those certifications:
- https://www.comptia.org/faq/a/what-jobs-can-i-get-with-a-comptia-a-certification
- https://www.comptia.org/faq/network/what-jobs-can-i-get-with-comptia-network-certification

- https://www.comptia.org/faq/pentest/what-jobs-can-i-get-with-comptia-pentest-certification

The table below shows Kansas City Area job descriptions that feature entry-level (or close) jobs that require a single certification. While many below do not have job descriptions associated with them, that doesn't mean the certification is not valuable. Those certifications might instead be worth pursuing if coursework is aligned and a minimal to moderate amount of effort is required to pass the tests. Additionally, CompTia certifications have been around for a long time and are suited toward students entering a particular profession. I would recommend A+, Network+, and Security+ for just about anyone. Linux+ almost makes that same core list.

|Certification|HS Diploma<br>Required|Associates<br>Required|Bachelors<br>Required|Link to Job Descriptions|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|CompTia A+|Often|Sometimes|Rarely|[A+ Related Job Descriptions in Kansas City](/A+/)|
|CompTia Network+||||Few found in the Kansas City Area on 4/14/2022<br>Still a good foundation for employers|
|CompTia Linux+||||Few found in the Kansas City Area on 4/14/2022<br>Still a good foundation for employers|
|CompTia Security+||||Few found in the Kansas City Area on 4/14/2022<br>Still a good foundation for employers|
|CompTia CySA+|||||
|CompTia Pentest+|||||

## Explore Careers and Entry-Level Positions

The education, certifications, and job experience you seek should be informed by real actual jobs available in the geographic region you plan to work. Therefore, one of your first steps is to research those jobs through websites like LinkedIn, Google, Indeed, and others. Start by searching for the job you are interested in (in your desired geographic region). Next, look at the amount of education, experience, skills, and certifications required. Often, that desired first job will require considerably more experience than you have initially. So, your next step is to chart a path towards that job. What kind of experience does that future job require and is there another entry-level position (even though it may be less desirable) that provides you that experience and the opportunity to gain those additional skills? How many years experience do you need (how long at minimum should you stay in that entry-level position)?
