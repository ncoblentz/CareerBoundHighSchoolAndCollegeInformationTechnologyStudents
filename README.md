# Career Bound High School and College Information Technology Students
## Purpose
As a student, your end goal is not limited to getting good grades or getting into a good college. Instead, you are building skills and experience towards landing that first job that will lead to a life-time long career in the information technology sector. You may want to manage cloud infrastructure, write software or games, hack into networks and web applications, or create Internet of Things devices. To do that, you first have to be able to demonstrate to a potential employer that you should be interviewed - to get your foot into the door to be considered for that job. This resource is intended to complement the high school and college course you are taking with recommendations of certifications to pursue.

### Building Your Skills, Experience, and Earning Certifications
When employers review a candidate's resume and cover letter, they are discerning whether the person meets the qualifications for the posted job and deciding who would most likely be successful in that organization and role. They are going to weigh the skills and experience the candidate already brings to the table versus the amount of training (and time) it will take to get them fully functional in that role. You can make that decision easier for the employer by demonstrating your skills and experience through:
1. Certifications
2. Volunteer and work experience
3. Completed projects (whether for school or as a hobby) that the employer can access on Github (or a similar site)

## Certification Selection
To select the right certifications, you first must know what kind of career you would like to pursue. Then, you should consider entry-level job listings and the certifications they list as "required" and "desired". You want to stand out above the other candidates, so the more of those "required" and "desired" qualifications you can check, the better chance you have at being considered for that job. Additionally, the course work you pursue in high school and college will often be aligned to industry standard certifications - which might require only a nominal amount of additional studying to prepare you for and pass those exams. 

### CompTia Certifications
The following links provide a description of several CompTia certifications and the types of jobs typically associated with those certifications:

The table below shows Kansas City Area job descriptions that feature entry-level (or close) jobs that require a single certification. While many below do not have job descriptions associated with them, that doesn't mean the certification is not valuable. Those certifications might instead be worth pursuing if coursework is aligned and a minimal to moderate amount of effort is required to pass the tests. Additionally, CompTia certifications have been around for a long time and are suited toward students entering a particular profession. I would recommend A+, Network+, and Security+ for just about anyone. Linux+ almost makes that same core list.
