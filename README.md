# Certification and Career Recommendations for Johnson County, KS High School and College IT Students
**Purpose**
As a student, your end goal is not limited to getting good grades or getting into a good college. Instead, you are building skills and experience towards landing that first job that will lead to a life long career in the information technology sector. You may want to manage cloud infrastructure, design data centers, write software or games, hack into networks and web applications, or create Internet of Things devices. To do that, you first have to be able to demonstrate to a potential employer that you should be interviewed - to get your foot into the door to be considered for that job. This resource is intended to complement the high school and college courses you are taking with recommendations of certifications to pursue based on real job descriptions in the Kansas City area.

**Building Your Skills, Experience, and Earning Certifications**
When employers review a candidate's resume and cover letter, they are discerning whether the person meets the qualifications for the posted job and deciding who would most likely be successful in that organization and role. They are going to weigh the education, skills, and experience the candidate already brings to the table versus the amount of training (and time) it will take to get them fully functional in that role. You can make that decision easier for the employer by demonstrating your skills and experience through:
1. Certifications
2. Volunteer and work experience (at school, church, non-profit organizations, etc.)
3. Completed projects (whether for school or as a hobby) that the employer can access on Github and Youtube (or other similar sites)

More on certifications, projects, and displaying that work can be found within this presentation: [Johnson County Community College: So you Want to be an Application Security Engineer?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul6kdub0CuQ)

## Start Here
### Start From Where You Are
Where to start is influenced by whether you are a current high school versus college student AND your end goals for that immediate stage. 

- I am a high school student and I plan to get a job without pursuing a college degree...
- I am a high school student and I plan to pursue an associates or bachelors degree...
- I am a community college student...
- I am a student at a four year college...

### High School Student Pursuing a Job Without a College Degree

To get a job as a high school graduate, it's going to be critically important that you grow in maturity (attitude, punctuality, reliability, professionalism, ability to manage time well, meeting deadlines, etc.) as well as have some kind of external demonstration of skill and experience. While pursuing your high school courses, you should focus on gaining entry-level certifications and working or volunteering in the field you plan to pursue. 

Once you get that first job, continue to pursue more advanced certifications. Then, after gaining several years of experience (3 to 5 years), your options for employment greatly increase. You have an opportunity to move around to a more exciting specialty or a more desirable company. That doesn't mean you have to move companies however. Ideally, your current employer will recognize your value and promote you. 

Without a college degree, you may hit road bumps. Some companies and HR departments struggle to interview even the most qualified candidate simply because he or she doesn't have a college degree. To over come that, join professional organizations and build a wide variety of friendships across companies. Later, when you might need to change employers, those individuals may be able to get past otherwise difficult to surmount HR filters and you likewise can help them.

Alteratively, you can also pursue an associates or bachelors degree while working. Many employers have tuition reimbursement programs that will pay for your college (after the fact and often with a certain letter grade requirement). This effectively allows you to start earning a salary, take on zero debt, and pursue that degree with a lot more real world experience and maturity.

The following sections are going to be helpful for you to dig into further:
1. Explore entry-level positions in your desired field
1. Pursue cerifications while in high school (and after getting that entry-level position)
2. Get internships, apprenticeships, or volunteering in the field you plan to work
3. Join outside professional organizations

### High School Student Pursuing an Associates or Bachelors Degree
If college is your next step as a high school student, you have a variety of options, including pursuing a Certificate or Associates degree at a community college as well as going to a four year college (either immediately or after community college). The strategy and decisions about which path to pick is beyond the scope of this document, except in identifying community colleges in the Johnson County, Kansas area and the specific features of those programs that may aid you in getting to the IT career you desire. Let's start first by identifying opportunities at the high school level to gain college credit and pursue certifiations.

School districts in the Johnson County, KS area have a variety of ways to begin earning college credit while still in school. Those options include:
- AP classes and testing for college credit
- Dual credit classes
- Testing out of classes (Credit by Examination) at the college level
- Release to from high school to go take community college classes (some for free)
- Agreements in which high school teachers teach college courses (like Shawnee Mission's Center for Academic Excellence or Olathe's 21st Century Academies)
- Get high school and college credit for an internship

Additionally, you may be interested in building up professional certifications and experience. Currently, no Johnson County, KS area high school programs and classes (that I'm aware of) specifically line up with any IT related certifications, so you would need to pursue those independently (more on this below). As far as work experience, siimlar to getting a job after high school, you will want to pursue internships or volunteer opportunities. However, earning college credit and getting close to that finish line of earning a degree will often be the higher priority.

The following sections are going to be helpful for you to dig into further:
- While still in high school:
  1. Explore entry-level positions in your desired field
  2. Considering programs available at area school districts and high schools
  3. Earning college credit while in high school
- When planning for college:
  1. Consider programs available at area colleges
  1. Pursue cerifications while in college
  2. Get internships, apprenticeships, or volunteering in the field you plan to work

## Explore Careers and Entry-Level Positions

The education, certifications, and job experience you seek should be informed by real actual jobs available in the geographic region you plan to work. Therefore, one of your first steps is to research those jobs through websites like LinkedIn, Google, Indeed, and others. Start by searching for the job you are interested in (in your desired geographic region). Next, look at the amount of education, experience, skills, and certifications required. Often, that desired first job will require considerably more experience than you have initially. So, your next step is to chart a path towards that job. What kind of experience does that future job require and is there another entry-level position (even though it may be less desirable) that provides you that experience and the opportunity to gain those additional skills? How many years experience do you need (how long at minimum should you stay in that entry-level position)? What other education and/or certifications should you pursue while in that entry-level position? Create a plan for getting to that future dream job. You are then going to then look for opportunities to meet those goals while in high school, college, and while at that first job.

### Certification Selection
To select the right certifications, you first must know what kind of career you would like to pursue. Then, you should consider entry-level job listings and the certifications they list as "required" and "desired". You want to stand out above the other candidates, so the more of those "required" and "desired" qualifications you can check, the better chance you have at being considered for that job. Additionally, the course work you pursue in high school and college will often be aligned to industry standard certifications - which might require only a nominal amount of additional studying to prepare you for and pass those exams. 

#### CompTia Certifications
The following links provide a description of several CompTIA certifications and the types of jobs typically associated with those certifications:
- https://www.comptia.org/faq/a/what-jobs-can-i-get-with-a-comptia-a-certification
- https://www.comptia.org/faq/network/what-jobs-can-i-get-with-comptia-network-certification
- https://www.comptia.org/faq/security/what-jobs-can-i-get-with-comptia-security-certification
- https://www.comptia.org/faq/cysa/what-jobs-can-i-get-with-comptia-cysa-certification
- https://www.comptia.org/faq/pentest/what-jobs-can-i-get-with-comptia-pentest-certification

The table below shows Kansas City Area job descriptions that feature entry-level (or close) jobs that require a single certification. While many below do not have job descriptions associated with them, that doesn't mean the certification is not valuable. Those certifications might instead be worth pursuing if coursework is aligned and a minimal to moderate amount of effort is required to pass the tests. Additionally, CompTia certifications have been around for a long time and are suited toward students entering a particular profession. I would recommend A+, Network+, and Security+ for just about anyone. Linux+ almost makes that same core list.

|Certification|HS Diploma<br>Required|Associates<br>Required|Bachelors<br>Required|Link to Job Descriptions|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|CompTia A+|Often|Sometimes|Rarely|[A+ Related Job Descriptions in Kansas City](/A+/)|
|CompTia Network+||||Few found in the Kansas City Area on 4/14/2022<br>Still a good foundation for employers|
|CompTia Linux+||||Few found in the Kansas City Area on 4/14/2022<br>Still a good foundation for employers|
|CompTia Security+||||Few found in the Kansas City Area on 4/14/2022<br>Still a good foundation for employers|
