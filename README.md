# Career Bound High School and College Information Technology Students
## Purpose
As a student, your end goal is not limited to getting good grades or getting into a good college. Instead, you are building skills and experience towards landing that first job that will lead to a life long career in the information technology sector. You may want to manage cloud infrastructure, write software or games, hack into networks and web applications, or create Internet of Things devices. To do that, you first have to be able to demonstrate to a potential employer that you should be interviewed - to get your foot into the door to be considered for that job. This resource is intended to complement the high school and college courses you are taking with recommendations of certifications to pursue based on real job descriptions in the Kansas City area.

## Building Your Skills, Experience, and Earning Certifications
When employers review a candidate's resume and cover letter, they are discerning whether the person meets the qualifications for the posted job and deciding who would most likely be successful in that organization and role. They are going to weigh the skills and experience the candidate already brings to the table versus the amount of training (and time) it will take to get them fully functional in that role. You can make that decision easier for the employer by demonstrating your skills and experience through:
1. Certifications
2. Volunteer and work experience (at school, church, non-profit organizations, etc.)
3. Completed projects (whether for school or as a hobby) that the employer can access on Github and Youtube (or other similar sites)

More on certifications, projects, and displaying that work can be found within this presentation: [Johnson County Community College: So you Want to be an Application Security Engineer?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul6kdub0CuQ)

But, how do you know which certifications, what kind of experience, and which projects to complete? First, go to job searching websites like LinkedIn, Google, Indeed, and more to search for the job you are interested in (and the geographic region you want to work in). Next, look at the amount of education, experience, skills, and certifications required. Often, that desired first job will require considerably more experience than you have initially. So, your next step is to chart a path towards that job. What kind of experience does that future job require and is there another entry-level position (even though it may be less desirable) that provides you that experience and opportunity to gain those additional skills? How many years experience do you need (how long at minimum should you stay in that entry-level position)? What other education and/or certification should you pursue in that entry-level position? Create a plan for getting to that future dream job.

### Certification Alignment With Curricula
The following sections list High School or College programs and the certifications that align with required classes. Your goal as a student is to take each exam related to the coursework the certification is aligned to. You may have to do additional study and hands-on activities to fully prepare you for the exam. Please contact the school to understand how closely the curricula fullfills the learning requirements towards that certification.

### Certification Selection
To select the right certifications, you first must know what kind of career you would like to pursue. Then, you should consider entry-level job listings and the certifications they list as "required" and "desired". You want to stand out above the other candidates, so the more of those "required" and "desired" qualifications you can check, the better chance you have at being considered for that job. Additionally, the course work you pursue in high school and college will often be aligned to industry standard certifications - which might require only a nominal amount of additional studying to prepare you for and pass those exams. 

#### CompTia Certifications
The following links provide a description of several CompTIA certifications and the types of jobs typically associated with those certifications:
- https://www.comptia.org/faq/a/what-jobs-can-i-get-with-a-comptia-a-certification
- https://www.comptia.org/faq/network/what-jobs-can-i-get-with-comptia-network-certification
- https://www.comptia.org/faq/security/what-jobs-can-i-get-with-comptia-security-certification
- https://www.comptia.org/faq/cysa/what-jobs-can-i-get-with-comptia-cysa-certification
- https://www.comptia.org/faq/pentest/what-jobs-can-i-get-with-comptia-pentest-certification

The table below shows Kansas City Area job descriptions that feature entry-level (or close) jobs that require a single certification. While many below do not have job descriptions associated with them, that doesn't mean the certification is not valuable. Those certifications might instead be worth pursuing if coursework is aligned and a minimal to moderate amount of effort is required to pass the tests. Additionally, CompTia certifications have been around for a long time and are suited toward students entering a particular profession. I would recommend A+, Network+, and Security+ for just about anyone. Linux+ almost makes that same core list.

|Certification|HS Diploma<br>Required|Associates<br>Required|Bachelors<br>Required|Link to Job Descriptions|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|CompTia A+|Often|Sometimes|Rarely|[A+ Related Job Descriptions in Kansas City](/A+/)|
